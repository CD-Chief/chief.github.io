          The expense tracker project was my second project working on react after the counter project.
           Both being my own projects I decided to dive deeper into the complexity of react. I explored
            the passing of data across and between components using props and contexts to connect my application. 
        </p>

        <h3>Key Features</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Add expenses</li>
          <li>Filter expenses based on name category and value</li>
          <li>Switch between create and filter for a clean UI</li>
          <li>Calculate and display the total records and sum of values</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Challenges</h3>
        <p>Challenges as mentioned before included correctly and efficiently passing data around to access
          where needed
        </p>
        <h3>Outcome</h3>
        <p>
          Overall this project was actually quite challenging as it was in a way programming in a way I never had to before
          which also included the planning stage before the programming, making sure I knew the structure before beginning
        </p>
        <h3>Future improvements</h3>
        <p>
          In the future I could definitely add the ability to delete and edit records similar to how I did this in my to-do list project.
          As well as improve on my CSS as this is lacking on the project.

          This project simulated a real-world professional environment by working in a group of four with unfamiliar
          team members. My responsibility was to design and implement most of the classes and their methods, laying the foundation
          for the project. Effective communication was crucial to ensure compatibility between features, and we
          scheduled multiple meetings to discuss various aspects of the code, ensuring that all components aligned
          towards our goal. Despite multiple teamates not doing their part, we were able to bring the project to about 
          80% completion before the deadline due to me and another colleague doing more than we had planned to.
        </p>
        <h3>Key Features</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Create and take quizzes with free-response and multiple-choice questions</li>
          <li>Automatic marking system for submitted quizzes</li>
          <li>Database integration for quiz storage and results</li>
          <li>Advanced use of Git for version control</li>
          <li>Unit testing for core functionality</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Challenges</h3>
        <p>
          One of the biggest challenges was working in a team of five, which included managing version control and task delegation.
           Communication was sometimes weak, particularly when certain team members didnâ€™t complete their assigned tasks on time,
            leading to inefficiencies. Additionally, learning to properly use Git in a team setting was difficult for some members,
             resulting in mistakes with versioning.
        </p>

        <h3>Outcome</h3>
        <p>
          Although the project was not fully completed, we achieved around 85% of the functionality, including the quiz system, basic
           database integration, and testing. The biggest issue was the lack of communication and organization within the team, which
            led to duplicated efforts and some features not functioning correctly. However, I gained valuable experience working in a
             team and learned the importance of clear communication and proper planning in software development.
        </p>

        <h3>Future Improvements</h3>
        <p>
          In the future, I would prioritize more structured planning, such as creating a roadmap to outline dependencies and improve workflow.
           Increased communication through regular team meetings and ensuring that everyone understands how to properly use Git would help
            avoid version control issues. Additionally, creating UML diagrams and flowcharts to visualize class interactions would have made 
            the development process smoother.
